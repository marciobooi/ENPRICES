  "TABTITLE1": "Energy data",
  "TAB1": "Energy statistics are in the spotlight due to their strategic importance to the drive towards competitive and sustainable economic growth. In recent years, the European Union has faced a number of important energy issues related to e.g. climate change, energy security and affordability. These have pushed the topic of energy towards the top of national and European political agendas, with energy statistics providing key information for policy makers. In order to meet policy makers' growing needs for data on energy, Eurostat has developed a coherent and harmonised system of energy statistics. Annual, half-yearly and monthly data collections cover the Member States of the EU, European Economic Area countries, candidate countries, potential candidates and Energy Community Contracting Partners.",

  "TABTITLE2": "Annual energy data",
  "TAB2": "These are annual data on crude oil, oil products, natural gas, electricity, derived heat, solid fossil fuels, renewables and wastes covering the full spectrum of the energy balance positions from supply through transformation to final energy consumption by sector and fuel type.  Eurostat has developed an <a href=\"//ec.europa.eu/eurostat/cache/sankey/energy/sankey.html\" target=\"_blank\"><u>interactive tool</u></a>  to visualise annual energy data by means of flow diagrams (also called Sankey diagrams). The tool allows you to build and customise your own diagram by playing with different options (country, year, fuel, level of detail, etc.).",

  "TABTITLE3": "Monthly energy data",
  "TAB3": "Eurostat collects and publishes monthly energy data on supply and to a limited extent consumption of various fuels; this data currently covers the coals / solid fossil fuels, natural gas, oil and petroleum products and electricity. Eurostat has developed an interactive tool to visualise monthly energy data.",

  "TABTITLE4": "Energy prices",
  "TAB4": "These are half-yearly and yearly data on electricity and natural gas prices provided for both final non-households as well as for households customers and for different consumption bands. Half-yearly prices are provided without taxes, with VAT and with all taxes included. Yearly data consist of more disaggregated prices on the energy cost, the network cost and the taxes. In addition, it also includes national average prices for each of these disaggregated sub-components. Eurostat has developed an <a href=\"//ec.europa.eu/eurostat/cache/infographs/energy_prices/enprices.html\" target=\"_blank\"><u>interactive tool</u></a> to visualise energy prices data.",

  "TABTITLE5": "Energy indicators",
  "TAB5": "Eurostat produces some selected energy indicators covering the major European policy areas (for example: the share of energy from renewable sources). Eurostat has developed an interactive tool to visualise energy indicators.",
